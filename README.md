# miscserverstuff

## A collection of features/tweaks to add to my personal SMP

The changes are as follows:
- Fire charges can be thrown by the player. They are a blaze fireball, not a ghast one. You can sneak and right-click a block to ignite it like normal.
- Phantoms only spawn on players who are 150 blocks away from their spawn point or more.
- The Knockback Enchantment can be put on Sticks and Blaze Rods.
- The Sharpness, Smite, and Bane of Arthropods enchantments can be put on Hoes.
- RepairCost no longer increases as you upgrade tools.

Previous Changes that have since been removed:
- You can no longer put Mending on an Elytra.

Note that these are all changes that are specifically implemented for my server and are subjective; however, all of these changes are implemented in just one mixin, so you can easily remove them or add them to your own projects.

Anyway thats it. I might make the phantom thing its own mod, but IDK. :]
